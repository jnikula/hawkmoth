Hawkmoth - Sphinx Autodoc for C
===============================

Hawkmoth is a minimalistic Sphinx_ :any:`C Domain <sphinx:c-domain>` autodoc
directive extension to incorporate formatted C source code comments written in
reStructuredText_ into Sphinx based documentation. It uses Clang_ Python
Bindings for parsing, and generates C Domain directives for C API documentation,
and more. In short, Hawkmoth is Sphinx Autodoc for C.

Hawkmoth aims to be a compelling alternative for documenting C projects using
Sphinx, mainly through its simplicity of design, implementation and use.

Please see the `Hawkmoth project GitHub page`_ (or README.rst in the source
repository) for information on how to obtain, install, and contribute to
Hawkmoth, as well as how to contact the developers.

Read on for information about Hawkmoth installation details and usage; how to
configure and use the extension and how to write documentation comments, with
examples.
