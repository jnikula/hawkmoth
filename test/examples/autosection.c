/**
 * .. _Hyperlink Target:
 *
 * This is a generic documentation comment.
 *
 * Because generic documentation comments aren't attached to any symbols, the
 * comment itself has to contain a name that can be referenced from the
 * ``c:autosection`` or ``cpp:autosection`` directive.
 *
 * The name shall be from the first alphanumeric character in the comment,
 * inclusive, to the next :, ., or newline, non-inclusive. This means
 * reStructuredText hyperlink targets become reference names, like in this case,
 * but it does not have to be a hyperlink target. It could just be the first
 * sentence in the comment.
 *
 * No hyperlink targets are generated automatically. If you need to reference
 * the comment from reStructuredText, you need to add one yourself.
